  objective: "My client, a software development firm, is in a dispute with a customer over a project that was delayed due to unforeseen staff shortages.\n\n1. First, research Indian contract law precedents regarding 'time is of the essence' clauses and how they are interpreted when faced with non-force majeure delays like staff shortages.\n2. Based on the initial findings, predict the likely outcome if this case goes to the Delhi High Court.\n3. Then, draft a formal settlement offer to the customer. The offer should propose a 15% discount on the final project payment as a gesture of goodwill for the delay.\n4. After drafting the offer, review the entire context and drafted offer for any potential risks or liabilities we might be exposing ourselves to.\n5. Next, I need to prepare for negotiation. The customer's current position is that they should receive a 50% discount. Generate alternative clauses and negotiation strategies assuming they have an aggressive style.\n6. Finally, their lead project manager will be a key witness. Prepare me for cross-examination by analyzing their likely statement 'The project was consistently behind schedule from week one' against our evidence that 'initial delays were approved in writing via email'."
